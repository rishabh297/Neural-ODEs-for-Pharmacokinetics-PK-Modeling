The model code provided in "Supplementary_File1_MathematicaModel.nb" has been tested on Wolfram Mathematica versions 12.0 and 12.1.0, on Mac and Linux platforms. 

The code can be run by selecting under the Mathematica menu: "Evaluation" > "Evaluate Notebook". Please see the link (https://www.wolfram.com/player/) for installation instructions of the freely available Wolfram Player, or the link (https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica) for Wolfram Mathematica.

Other than Wolfram Player/Mathematica, no other non-standard software is required. The model code generates the model neural network, which can subsequently be exported to various formats including WLNet.
